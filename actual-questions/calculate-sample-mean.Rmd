```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
pacman::p_load(exams, tidyverse)
sample <- rnorm(8, mean = 7, sd = 2.5)
sample <- round(sample,1)
length <- length(sample)
sol <- round(mean(sample),1)
```

Question
===============
Calculate the sample mean for the following sample: 
$$`r sample`$$
Please give your answer to 1 decimal place. 



Solution
========
We obtain the mean of a sample using 
$$ mean = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$$
in this case: 
$$ mean = \frac{\sum (`r fmt(sample,1)`)}{`r fmt(length)`} = `r sol`$$

In R, the data can be entered using:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat('sample=c(',paste(sample, collapse=','), ')\n', sep = '')

```


Then you can compute the mean like so:
 
```{r}
mean(sample)
```
 
which rounded to one decimal place is `r sol`.
