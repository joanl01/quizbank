```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
choices <- character(4)

choices[1] <- "When the sample size is small ($n<15$)"
choices[2] <- "When the sample has strong skew"
choices[3] <- "When the sample size is large"
choices[4] <- "When the population is known to be bimodal"

sol <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)


```



Question 
================
When is the normality assumption for the one-sample t-test least critical? 

```{r questionlist, echo=FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(choices, markup = "markdown")
```



Solution
================
With large samples, the sample mean is approximately normal due to the Central Limit Theorem.


The correct answer is

```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(ifelse(sol, "TRUE", "FALSE"), markup = "markdown")
```
