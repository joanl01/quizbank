```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
sources <- c("gym members", "smartwatch users", "university email list", "social media poll")
source <- sample(sources, 1)

choices <- character(4)
choices[1] <- "Recall bias"
choices[2] <- "Measurement bias"
choices[3] <- "Selection bias"
choices[4] <- "Confounding bias"

sol <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)


```


Question
=================
A study on physical activity recruits participants by sending a survery to `r source`
Which bias is likely to affect this study? 
```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(choices,  markup = "markdown")
```



Solution
==============
The sample is not representative of the general poulation

The correct answer is 
```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sol, markup = "markdown")
```





Meta-information
================
extype: schoice
exsolution: `r mchoice2string(sol, single = TRUE)`
exname: sampling-bias-which-type
exshuffle: TRUE
