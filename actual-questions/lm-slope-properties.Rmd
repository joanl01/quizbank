```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
ans <- character(4)

ans[1] <- "The slope tells us the predicted value of $Y$ when $X = 0$."
ans[2] <- "The slope represents the change in $Y$ for a one-unit increase in $X$, holding other variables constant."
ans[3] <-  "The slope measures how well the model fits the data."
ans[4] <- "The slope is always between $-1$ and $1$."
sol <- c(0,1,0,0)
```

Question
==================
In the simple linear regression model  

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon,
$$  

which of the following statements about the slope coefficient $\beta_1$ is true?
```{r questionlist, echo=FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(ans, markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
=================
The correct answer is

```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(ifelse(sol, "TRUE", "FALSE"), markup = "markdown")
```
