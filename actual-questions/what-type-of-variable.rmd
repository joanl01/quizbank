Question 
==================
For the following data collected by a very hardworking scientist doing research, state whether the variable is categorical nominal, categorical ordinal, quantitative discrete, or quantitative continuous.

`r question[random]`



```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(list_of_ans,  markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
===========================


```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(ifelse(sol, "True", "False"), markup = "markdown")
```







Meta-information
================
extype: schoice
exsolution: `r mchoice2string(sol, single = TRUE)`
