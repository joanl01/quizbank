```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, exams)
data(mtcars)

lm <- lm(mpg~wt, data = mtcars)


sol <- round(lm$coefficients[2], 2)
```

Question 
============
You are working as a data analyst for an environmental research group studying the relationship between car characteristic and fuel efficiency. Your research team is particularly interested in how the the cars' miles per gallon (`mpg`) performance is influcenced by weight of the car (`wt`).

The output of the linear regression fitted is shown below:
```{r test output, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
summary(lm)
```


What is the estimated slope coefficient for this model? (Give your answer to 2 decimal places)



Solution
===========
The slope estimate is the number under the `estimate` column, and the `wt` row

which rounded to 2 decimal places is `r sol`.

Meta-information
================
extype: num
exsolution: `r fmt(sol, 2)`
extol: 0.01
exname: calculate sample mean
