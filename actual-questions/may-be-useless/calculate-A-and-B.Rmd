```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
probA <- sample(seq(from= 0, to = 1, by = 0.01),1)
probB <- sample(seq(from= 0, to = 1, by = 0.01),1)

sol <- round(probA*probB,2)

```

Question
===============
An event A has a probability `r probA` of occurring; and an event B has a probability of `r probB`of occurring. Assuming that the two events are independent, calculate P(A and B) to 2 decimal places. 


Solution
=======================
When two events are independent, P(A and B) $= P(A) \times P(B)$, which rounded to 2 decimal places is `r sol`
