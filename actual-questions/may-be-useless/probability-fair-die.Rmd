```{r}
choices <- character(4)
choices[1] <- "1/6"
choices[2] <- "1/3"
choices[3] <- "1"
choices[4] <- "0"
sol <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)
```
Question
======================
A fair six sided die is rolled. Let X be the event that a six is rolled. What is P(A)?


```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(choices,  markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
=======================
The sample space of the die consists of 6 elements $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. The die is fair, which means the probability of each number being rolled is the same across all 6 numbers. Therefore each number has a probability of $1/6$.

The correct answer is 
```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sol, markup = "markdown")
```
