```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

choices <- character(4)
choices[1] <- "It remains right-skewed"
choices[2] <- "It is approximately normal"
choices[3] <- "It matches the population exactly"
choices[4] <-  "It is uniform"

sol <- c( F, T, F, F)
```
Question
===============

The population distribution is strongly right-skewed. Samples of size 50 are taken.
What is true about the sampling distribution of the mean?

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(choices,  markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
==========
With large samples, the distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal. 

The correct answer is 
```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sol, markup = "markdown")
```
