```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
ans <- character(4)


ans[1] <- "The intercept tells us the predicted value of $Y$ when $X = 0$."
ans[2] <- "The intercept represents the change in $Y$ for a one-unit increase in $X$, holding other variables constant."
ans[3] <-  "The intercept measures the strength of the linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$"
ans[4] <- "The intercept is always 0."
sol <- c(1,0,0,0)
