Question
======================
The event A has a probability `r probA` of occuring, and the event B has a probability `r prob B` of occuring. Also it is known that P(A and B) = `r AnB`. Calculate P(A or B) to 2 decimal places. 


Solution
=======================
From the question, we know P(A) = `r probA`, P(B) = `r probB`, and P(A $\cap$ B) = `r AnB`. Therefore substituting the values into the formula:
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$
which gives `r sol` when rounded to 2 decimal places.
