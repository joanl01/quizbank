```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, exams)

choices <- character(4)
choices[1] <- "{1,2,3,4,5,6}, categorical"
choices[2] <- "{1,2,3,4,5,6}, numerical"
choices[3] <- "{even, odd}, categorical"
choices[4] <- "All real numbers between 1 and 6, continuous"

sol <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)


```

Question 
================
A fair six-sided dice is rolled once, and the outcome is recorded. 
What is the sample size and what type of variable is recorded?

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(choices, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
====================
The outcome takes numeric disrete values from a sample space 

The correct answer is 
```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sol, markup = "markdown")
```
