```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
ans <- character(4)

ans[1] <- "Fitted values vs residuals plot"
ans[2] <- "Normal Q-Q plot"
ans[3] <-  "Plot of $Y$ (response variable) vs $X$ (independent variable)"
ans[4] <- "Fitted values vs observed values plot"
sol <- c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE)


```

Question
==================
Which of the following plots would you use to test the assumption of linearity of a model?

```{r questionlist, echo=FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(ans, markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
=================
The correct answer is

```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(ifelse(sol, "TRUE", "FALSE"), markup = "markdown")
```


The plot used to check the assumption of linearity is the residuals vs fitted plot.
