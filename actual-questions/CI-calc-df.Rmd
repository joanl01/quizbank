```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
rand_n <- sample(35:60, 1)
choices <- c(rand_n-1, rand_n, rand_n+1, "depends on the confidence level")
sol <- choices == (rand_n-1)

```


Question
======================
A random sample of `r rand_n`observations is used to construct a confidence interval for a population mean, using the t-distribution.

What are the degrees of freedom used to find the critical value?
```{r questionlist, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
answerlist(choices, markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
=================
The degrees of freedom used to find the critical value is $n-1$, where $n$ is the nmber of observations. 

The correct answer is 
```{r answerlist, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
answerlist(sol, markup = "markdown")
```
