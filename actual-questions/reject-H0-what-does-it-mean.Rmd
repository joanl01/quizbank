```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
choices <- character(4)
choices[1] <- "The null hypothesis is false"
choices[2] <- "The alternative hypothesis is true"
choices[3] <- "There is sufficient evidence against the null hypothesis"
choices[4] <- "The result is practically important"

sol <- c(F, F, T, F)

```


Question
==================
What does it mean to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$?
```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(choices,  markup = "markdown")
```



Solution
================
Rejecting the null hypothesis means the data provide sufficient statistical evidence against it and not that it is proven false.

The correct answer is 
```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sol, markup = "markdown")
```
