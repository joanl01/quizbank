```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, exams)
choices <- character(4)
choices[1] <- "Independence of observations"
choices[2] <- "Normality of residuals within groups"
choices[3] <- "Equal variances across groups" 
choices[4] <- "Equality of sample sizes across groups" 


sol <- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)


```

Question
==============
Which of the following is NOT an assumption of a one-way or two-way ANOVA?


```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(choices,  markup = "markdown")
```



Solution
==================
ANOVA does not require equal sample sizes. The core assumptions of ANOVA are indpendence, normality and equal variances. 


The correct answer is :
```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(ifelse(sol, "True", "False"), markup = "markdown")
```
