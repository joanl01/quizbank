```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

choices <- character(4)
choices[1] <- "Large sample size"
choices[2] <- "Small population variance"
choices[3] <- "Categorical data"
choicces[4] <-  "Perfect symmetry of the data's histogram"

sol <- c(T, F, F, F)
```
Question
===============

Which condition help justify using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(choices,  markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
==========
The CLT applies when the sample size is sufficiently large, regardless of population shape.


The correct answer is 
```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sol, markup = "markdown")
```
