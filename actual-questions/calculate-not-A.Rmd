```{r data generation, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
prob <- sample(seq(from= 0, to = 1, by = 0.01),1)
sol <- 1-prob
```

Question
====================
An event A has a probability `r prob` of occuring. Calculate the probability of A not occuring to 2 decimal places.


Solution
=======================
From the question, we know $P(A) = $ `r prob`, therefore the probability of A not occuring, which is $P(A^c) = 1-P(A)$, rounded to 2 decimal places is therefore `r sol`
